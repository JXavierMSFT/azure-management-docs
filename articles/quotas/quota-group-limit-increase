# Submit Quota Group Limit increase request
One of the key benefits of Quota Group offering is the ability to submit Quota Group Limit increase requests rather than at the per subscription level. If your group limit request is approved you can then follow steps to allocate/transfer quota from group to target subscriptions  for a given region x VM family.  
- Require *GroupQuota Request Operator* role on the Management Group to submit Quota Group limit increase request.
- Customers can submit Quota Group limit increase requests for a region x VM family combination, and if approved, quota will be stamped on the specified Quota GroupID.  
- Quota Group Limit increase requests undergo the same checks as subscription level requests. Value should be absolute value of the new desired amount.   
- If Quota Group  Limit request is rejected then customer must submit support ticket via the self-serve Quota group request blade.  
- Support tickets for Quota Groups will be created based on a preselected subscriptionID within the group, the customer has the ability to edit the subID when updating request details.
