# Azure Quota Groups (Preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Quota Groups are currently in preview. Previews are made available to you on the condition that you agree to the [supplemental terms of use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). Some aspects of this feature may change prior to general availability (GA).

Azure Quota Groups allow you to share quota among a group of subscriptions, reducing the number of quota transactions. This feature elevates the quota construct from a subscription level to a Quota Group Azure Resource Management (ARM) object, enabling customers to self-manage their procured quota within a group without needing approvals.

## Key benefits

- **Quota sharing across subscriptions**: Share procured quotas within a group of subscriptions.  
- **Self-service management**: Distribute or reallocate unused quota without Microsoft intervention.  
- **Fewer support requests**: Avoid filing support tickets when reallocating quota or managing new subscriptions.  
- **Group quota requests**: Request quota at the group level and allocate it across subscriptions as needed.  


## Supported scenarios  

- Deallocation: Transfer unused quota from your subscriptions to Group Quota. 
- Allocation: Transfer quota from group to target subscriptions. 
- Submit Quota Group increase request for a given region and Virtual Machine (VM) family. Once your request is approved, transfer quota from group to target subscriptions. 
- Quota Group increase requests are subject to the same checks as subscription quota increase requests. If capacity is low, then the request is rejected. 

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the Quota Group feature, you must:  
- Register the `Microsoft.Quota` and `Microsoft.Compute` resource provider on all relevant subscriptions using PowerShell.  
- A Management Group (MG) is needed to create a Quota Group. Your group will inherit quota write and or read permissions from the Management Group. Subscriptions belonging to another MG can be added to the Quota Group.
- Certain permissions are required to create Quota Groups and to add subscriptions. For more information on which roles to assign, see [#permissions].   

## Limitations

- Available only for Enterprise Agreement and Internal subscriptions. 
- Supports IaaS compute resources only.  
- Available in public cloud regions only.  
- Management Group deletion will result in the loss of access to the Quota Group limit. To clear out the group limit, allocate cores to subscriptions, delete subscriptions, then the Quota Group object before deletion of Management Group. In the even that the MG is deleted, access your Quota Group limit by recreating the MG with the same ID as before.

## Quota Group is an ARM object

Quota Group is a global ARM object created under a Management Group to logically group subscriptions for quota management. While it is tied to the Management Group for permissions, it doesn't auto-sync subscription membership. This means you have full flexibility to include subscriptions from different Management Groups. Quota Groups are: 

- Quota Groups are created at the Management Group scope (not the Root Management Group).
- Quota Groups are inherit permissions from its parent Management Group.
- Quota Groups are designed as an orthogonal grouping mechanism. They're independent of subscription placement in the Management Group hierarchy.
- Subscription lists are not auto-synced from Management Groups, giving you flexibility to organize quotas separately from policy or role management.

The following diagram shows and existing MG hierarchy set up with *subscription 1* and *subscription 2* being part of *Management Group A*, and *subscription 3* being part of *Management Group B*. In this example, the customer chose to create all quota groups under the single *Management Group A*.

## Recommended group setup

A single Quota Group object manages quotas across multiple regions and VM families. Design your quota group structure with access control in mind. Access is inherited from the Management Group, so consider creating a tiered Management Group structure to ensure proper role assignments.  

Example hierarchy:  
- Management Group A owns Quota Groups 1 & 2.
- Management Group B owns Quota Group 3.
- Each quota group may be used to manage different applications, departments, and or regions.
- When performing operations such as quota transfers or increase requests, actions are scoped to specific regions and VM families.

## Permissions

Certain permissions are required to create Quota Groups and to add subscriptions. For more information, see [Assign Azure roles using Azure CLI](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli) or [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).
- Assign the *GroupQuota Request Operator* role on the Management Group where the Quota Group will be created.
- Assign the *Quota Request Operator* role on all participating subscriptions to the relevant users or applications managing quota operations.

<!-- Please write at least a sentance to introduce this subsection. -->

### [REST API](#tab/rest-1)
To create a Quota Group using the REST API, make a `PUT` request to the following endpoint:

```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{managementGroupId}/providers/Microsoft.Quota/groupQuotas/{groupquota}?api-version=2025-03-01 
```

Request body:
```json
{
  "properties": {
    "displayName": "allocationGroupTest"
  }
}
```

Sample response: 
```json
user [ ~ ]$ az rest --method put --url https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{managementGroupId}/providers/Microsoft.Quota/groupQuotas/{groupquota}?api-version=2025-03-01 --body '{
  "properties": {
    "displayName": "allocationGroupTest"
  }
}'
{
  "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{managementGroupId}/providers/Microsoft.Quota/groupQuotas/{groupquota}",
  "name": "{groupquota}",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "ACCEPTED"
  },
  "type": "Microsoft.Quota/groupQuotas"
}
```

### [Azure portal](#tab/portal-1)
Create a Quota Group through the Azure portal.

1. To view the Quotas page, sign in to the Azure portal and enter "quotas" into the search box, then select **Quotas**.
2. Under settings in left hand side select **Quota groups**.
3. To view existing Quota group select **Management Group** filter and select management group used to create Quota Group
4. Select **Create** button to go to Create Quota Group view
5. In the **Basics** tab, fill out required fields such name of Quota group. Quota Group name cannot contain any special characters and or spaces.
6. Select **Management group**, if the default Management group is not the desired one, select **Change management group**, then select **Next** button.
7. In the **Subscripion selection** tab select subscription(s) to be added to quota group. Subscription will be greyed out and unable to be selected if it already belongs to existing Quota Group, then  select **Next** button.
8. In **Review + create** tab review details of Quota group before creation. Under **Basics** name of Quota Group will be displayed, under **Group selection** the selected Management group and subscription(s) will be displayed


<!-- The following is an example of the format we use to write out portal instructions. Be clear, concise, only bold or italicise actual names of blades and options, etc. Start instructions from the start of openning the portal.

1. Go to **Virtual machine scale sets**.
2. Select the **Create** button to go to the **Create a virtual machine scale set** view.
3. In the **Basics** tab, fill out the required fields. If the field isn't called out in the next sections, you can set the fields to what works best for your scale set.
4. Ensure that you select a region that instance mix is supported in.
5. Be sure **Orchestration mode** is set to **Flexible**.
6. In the **Size** section, click **Select up to 5 sizes** and the **Select a VM size** page appears.
7. Use the size picker to select up to five VM sizes. Once you select your VM sizes, click the **Select** button at the bottom of the page to return to the scale set Basics tab.
8. In the **Allocation strategy** field, select your allocation strategy.
9. Using the `Prioritized (preview)` allocation strategy, the **Rank size** section appears below the Allocation strategy section. Clicking on the bottom **Rank priority** brings up the prioritization blade, where you can adjust the priority of your VM sizes.
10. You can specify other properties in subsequent tabs, or you can go to **Review + create** and select the **Create** button at the bottom of the page to start your instance mix scale set deployment.

## Transfer unused quota

Transfer unused quota from your subscription to a Quota Group or from a Quota Group to a subscription.

<!-- Please write clearer instructional content, preferably step-by-step, as with previous sections. Write full sentences, even on bulleted lists. Or mention specific properties that need to be adjusted, and be very explicit about those details. If you need REST and portal tabs, copy the format from previous sections. -->

To deallocate or transfer quota from subscription to group, set the limit property as absolute value to the new desired subscription limit. If you want to transfer 10 cores of *standarddv4family* to your group and your current subscription limit is 120, set the new limit to 110.  

To allocate or transfer quota from group to subscription, set the limit property to the new desired subscription limit. If your current subscription quota is 110 and you want to transfer 10 cores from group to target subscription, set the new limit to 120.  

## PATCH subscription quota allocation

### Increase escalations

<!-- Please write clearer instructional content, preferably step-by-step, as with previous sections. Write full sentences, even on bulleted lists. Avoid bulleted lists of information that can be written in paragraph format. If you do write a list, there should be a clear purpose to the grouping, etc. Do not duplicate information you already mentioned before unless absolutely necessary. Find the most appropriate spot to unpack said information and do it in one central place. If you need to mention it elsewhere, do it briefly and link to the central location for more information. If you need REST and portal tabs, copy the format from previous sections. -->

- Customers can submit Quota Group increase requests for a region x VM family combination, and if approved, quota will be stamped on the specified Quota GroupID.  
- Quota Group increase requests undergo the same checks as subscription level requests.  
- Whether you submit a request via portal or API, your request will be reviewed, and you'll be notified if the request can be fulfilled. This usually happens within a few minutes. If your request isn't fulfilled, you'll see a link 	where you can open a support request so that a support engineer can assist you with the increase.  
- Support tickets for Quota Groups will be created based on a preselected subscriptionID within the group, the customer has the ability to edit the subID when updating request details.
