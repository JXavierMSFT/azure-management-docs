# View and filter Azure resource information

The Azure portal enables you to browse detailed information about resources across your Azure subscriptions. This article shows you how to filter information and use different views to better understand your resources.

This article focuses on filtering information in the **All resources** pane. Panes for individual resource types and services may have different options, but many of the same concepts apply.

## Filter resources

Start exploring **All resources** by using filters to focus on a subset of your resources. The following screenshot shows filtering on resource groups, selecting two of the three resource groups in a subscription.

You can combine multiple filters, including filters based on text searches. For example, after selecting specific resource groups, you can enter text in the filter box, or select a different filter option.

To change which columns are included in a view, select **Manage view**, then select **Edit columns**.

:::image type="content" source="media/manage-filter-resource-views/edit-columns.png" alt-text="Edit columns shown in view":::

You can then add, remove, and rearrange columns. When you're finished, select **Save**.

## Save, use, and delete views

You can save views that include the filters and columns you selected. To save and use a view:

1. Select **Manage view**, then select **Save view**.

1. Enter a name for the view, then select **Save**. The saved view now appears in the **Manage view** menu.

    :::image type="content" source="media/manage-filter-resource-views/simple-view.png" alt-text="Saved view":::

Try switching between **Default** and one of your own views to see how that affects the list of resources displayed.

You can also select **Choose favorite view** to use one of your views as the default views for **All resources**.

To delete a view that you created:

1. Select **Manage view**, then select **Browse all views for "All resources"**.

1. In the **Saved views** pane, select the **Delete** icon ![Delete view icon](media/manage-filter-resource-views/icon-delete.png) next to the view that you want to delete. Select **OK** to confirm the deletion.

## Export information from a view

You can export the resource information from a view. To export information in CSV format:

1. Select **Export to CSV**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/manage-filter-resource-views/export-csv.png" alt-text="Screenshot of exporting to CSV format":::

1. Save the file locally, then open the file in Excel or another application that supports the CSV format.

As you move around the portal, you may see other areas where you can export information, such as an individual resource group.

## Summarize resources with visuals

The views described so far are _list views_, which show resources in lists that you can customize. The **All resources** pane also provides _summary views_ that include visual representations. You can save and use these views just like you can with list views. Filters persist between the two types of views.

There are different types of summary views. For example, the **Location** view shows resources across regions.

:::image type="content" source="media/manage-filter-resource-views/summary-map.png" alt-text="Summary of resources in a map view":::

To save and use a summary view:

1. From the view menu, select **Summary view**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/manage-filter-resource-views/menu-summary-view.png" alt-text="Summary view menu":::

1. The summary view enables you to summarize by different attributes, including **Location** and **Type**. Select a **Summarize by** option and an appropriate visual. The following screenshot shows the **Type summary** with a **Bar chart** visual.

    :::image type="content" source="media/manage-filter-resource-views/type-summary-bar-chart.png" alt-text="Type summary showing a bar chart":::

1. Select **Manage view**, then select **Save view** to save this view, just like you did with the list view.

In the summary view, you can select an item to view details filtered to that item. Using the previous example, you can select a bar in the chart under **Type summary** to view a list filtered down to one type of resource.

## Run queries in Azure Resource Graph

Azure Resource Graph provides efficient and performant resource exploration with the ability to query at scale across a set of subscriptions. The **All resources** pane in the Azure portal includes a link to open a Resource Graph query scoped to the current filtered view.

To run a Resource Graph query:

1. Select **Open query**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/manage-filter-resource-views/open-query.png" alt-text="Open Azure Resource Graph query":::

1. In **Azure Resource Graph Explorer**, select **Run query** to see the results.

    :::image type="content" source="media/manage-filter-resource-views/run-query.png" alt-text="Run Azure Resource Graph query":::
