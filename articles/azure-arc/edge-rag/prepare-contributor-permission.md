## Verify contributor permissions

Verify that you have [Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#contributor) permissions for the subscription you want to use. See [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

Contributor role is required at the subscription level for the following commands:

```powershell
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration
az feature register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration --name extensions
```
