# Quickstart: Connect a Linux machine with Azure Arc-enabled servers (package-based installation)

Get started with [Azure Arc-enabled servers](overview.md) to manage and govern your Linux machines hosted across on-premises, edge, and multicloud environments.

In this quickstart, you'll deploy and configure the Azure Connected Machine agent on a Linux machine hosted outside of Azure, so that the machine can be managed through Azure Arc-enabled servers.
