# What's new with Azure Connected Machine agent

> [!WARNING]
> Effective January 2026, the Azure Connected Machine agent will no longer accept certificates with negative serial numbers, in compliance with RFC 5280 Section 4.1.2.2, which states that "the serial number MUST be a positive integer assigned by the CA to each certificate."

The Azure Connected Machine agent receives improvements on an ongoing basis. To stay up to date with the most recent developments, this article provides you with information about:

- The latest releases
- Known issues
