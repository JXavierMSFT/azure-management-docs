# Troubleshoot Azure Arc-enabled servers VM extension issues

This article provides information on troubleshooting and resolving issues that may occur while attempting to deploy or remove Azure virtual machine (VM) extensions on Azure Arc-enabled servers. For general information, see [Virtual machine extension management with Azure Arc-enabled servers](./manage-vm-extensions.md).

## General troubleshooting

Data about the state of extension deployments can be retrieved from the Azure portal by [selecting the applicable machine and then selecting **Settings > Extensions**](manage-vm-extensions-portal.md#list-extensions-installed).

The following troubleshooting steps apply to all VM extensions.

1. Ensure that the Azure Connected Machine agent (`azcmagent`) is connected and that the dependent services are *running/active*.

    Run the [`azcmagent show`](azcmagent-show.md) command and check the output for the status (*Azure Arc Proxy* can be ignored):

    If the services are stopped, restart the services to resume extension operations.

1. Retry extension installation.

    Extensions can stall in Creating/Updating or Fail status for various reasons. In this case, remove the extension and install it again. To remove an extension, use the following command:

    ```powershell
    Remove-AzConnectedMachineExtension -Name <Extension Name> -ResourceGroupName <RG Name> -MachineName <Machine Name>
    ```

1. Check the Guest agent log for the activity when your extension was being provisioned. For Windows, check in `%SystemDrive%\ProgramData\GuestConfig\ext_mgr_logs`, and for Linux check in `/var/lib/GuestConfig/ext_mgr_logs`.

1. Check the extension logs for the specific extension for more details.

    For Windows machines:
    - Logs reside in `C:\ProgramData\GuestConfig`
    - Extension settings and status files reside in `C:\Packages\Plugins`

    For Linux machines:
    - Logs reside in `/var/lib/GuestConfig`
    - Extension settings and status files reside in `/var/lib/waagent`

    Extension service logs are written to `â€¦GuestConfig\ext_mgr_logs\gc_ext.log`. Errors regarding downloading or verifying the packages are shown there.  

1. Check extension-specific documentation troubleshooting sections for error codes, known issues, or other details. You can find documentation for each extension in the [extensions table](manage-vm-extensions.md#extensions).

1. Look at the system logs. Check for other operations that may interfere with the extension, such as a long running installation of another application that required exclusive package manager access.
