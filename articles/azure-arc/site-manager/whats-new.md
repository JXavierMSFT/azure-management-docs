Address migration: Site address was previously stored as a separate resource via [Azure Edge Hardware Center](/azure/azure-edge-hardware-center/azure-edge-hardware-center-overview). With this release site address has been merged into the site resource and is no longer using a separate resource via Azure Edge Hardware Center. Additionally, only the physical address fields have been moved to site properties, and personal contact information is no longer stored. The fields that have been moved are as follows: Address line 1, Address line 2, City, Zip code, State/Province/Region, and Country/Region.
