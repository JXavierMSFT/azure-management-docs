# Discover Azure Marketplace solutions using Microsoft Copilot

Microsoft Copilot in Azure enables you to find the right Azure Marketplace solutions using natural language queries. Instead of relying on filters or knowing specific product names, you can describe your needs in your own words, and Copilot provides tailored suggestions.

When you ask a question in Copilot, the Discovery Plugin:

- Understands your intent (e.g., "secure APIs" â†’ API Gateway or WAF solutions).
- Enriches your query with context and inferred filters.
- Searches the Azure Marketplace using intelligent APIs.
- Returns relevant offers, services, or follow-ups.

All this happens in real time, within your Azure Copilot chat.

## Sample prompts

Here are a few examples of the kinds of prompts you can use to discover Azure Marketplace solutions. Modify these prompts based on your real-life scenarios, or try additional prompts to explore different solutions.

- "Show me database offers for scalable cloud storage."
- "List AI-powered virtual machine configurations for data analysis."
- "I am looking for a service to analyze customer sentiment from voice recordings."
