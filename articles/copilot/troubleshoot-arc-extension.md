# Troubleshoot extension failures for Azure Arc-enabled servers using Microsoft Copilot in Azure

Microsoft Copilot in Azure can help you troubleshoot issues with extensions deployed on Azure Arc-enabled servers. [Extensions](/azure/azure-arc/servers/manage-vm-extensions) are small applications that provide post-deployment configuration and automation tasks, like installation of software. Many of the Azure management services available for Arc-enabled servers require extensions.

When you ask Microsoft Copilot in Azure questions about troubleshooting extensions for Arc-enabled servers, it prompts you to select the Arc-enabled server and the extension that you are interested in troubleshooting. Copilot in Azure analyzes your current configuration and associated logs, then provides a summary of the issue and recommended remediation steps. When possible, Copilot in Azure will assist you with performing actions to help remediate the issue, such as reinstalling the extension.

## Sample prompts

- "Help me troubleshoot my failed extension on my arc-server"
- "Why is my extension on my Arc machine in a failed state?"

## Examples

When you ask Microsoft Copilot in Azure **"Help me troubleshoot my arc server extension"**, Copilot runs an analysis of your extension state and error logs. First, it asks you to confirm the affected machine:

If there are multiple extensions in a failed state, you'll be prompted to select the one you're interested in. Copilot in Azure then shows details about the error message and recommended troubleshooting steps.

In some cases, reinstalling the extension may be needed to fix the issue. When possible, Copilot in Azure will offer to help you reinstall it.
