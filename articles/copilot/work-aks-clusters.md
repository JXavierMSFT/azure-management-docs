# Work with AKS clusters efficiently using Microsoft Copilot in Azure

Microsoft Copilot in Azure can help you work more efficiently with [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) clusters.

When you ask Microsoft Copilot in Azure for help with AKS, it automatically pulls context when possible, based on the current conversation or on the page you're viewing in the Azure portal. If the context isn't clear, you're prompted to specify a cluster.

This video shows how Copilot in Azure can assist with AKS cluster management and configurations.

## Run cluster commands

You can use Microsoft Copilot in Azure to run kubectl commands based on your prompts. When you make a request that can be achieved by a kubectl command, you see the command along with the option to execute it directly in the **Run command** pane. This pane lets you [run commands on your cluster through the Azure API](/azure/aks/access-private-cluster?tabs=azure-portal), without directly connecting to the cluster. You can also copy the generated command and run it directly.

### Cluster command sample prompts

Here are a few examples of the kinds of prompts you can use to run kubectl commands on an AKS cluster. Modify these prompts based on your real-life scenarios, or try additional prompts to get different kinds of information.

- "List all my namespaces"
- "List all of my failed pods in this cluster"
- "Check the rollout status for deployment `aksdeployment`"
- "Get all pods that are in pending states in all namespaces"
- "Can you delete my deployment named `my-deployment` in namespace `my-namespace`?"
- "Scale the number of replicas of my deployment `my-deployment` to 5"
- "How do I get the status of all nodes in my AKS cluster?"
- "List all services in my AKS cluster with kubectl"

### Cluster command example

You can say **"List all namespaces in my cluster."** Copilot in Azure shows you the kubectl command to perform your request, and ask if you'd like to execute the command. If you're not already working in the context of a cluster, you're prompted to select one.  When you confirm, the **Run command** pane opens with the generated command included.

## Enable IP address authorization

Use Microsoft Copilot in Azure to quickly make changes to the IP addresses that are allowed to access an AKS cluster. When you reference your own IP address, Microsoft Copilot in Azure can add it to the authorized IP ranges, without your providing the exact address. If you want to include alternative IP addresses, Microsoft Copilot in Azure asks if you want to open the **Networking** pane for your AKS cluster and helps you edit the relevant field.

### IP address sample prompts

Here are a few examples of the kinds of prompts you can use to manage the IP addresses that can access an AKS cluster. Modify these prompts based on your real-life scenarios, or try additional prompts to get different kinds of information.

- "Allow my IP to access my AKS cluster"
- "Add my IP address to the allowlist of my AKS cluster's network policies"
- "Add my IP address to the authorized IP ranges of AKS cluster's networking configuration"
- "Add IP CIDR to my AKS clusterâ€™s authorized IP ranges"
- "Update my AKS cluster's authorized IP ranges"

## Manage cluster backups

Microsoft Copilot in Azure can help streamlines the process of installing the Azure [Backup extension](/azure/backup/azure-kubernetes-service-backup-overview) to an AKS cluster. On clusters where the extension is already installed, it helps you [configure backups](/azure/backup/azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-backup#configure-backups) and view existing backups.

When you ask for help with backups, you're prompted to select a cluster. From there, Microsoft Copilot in Azure prompts you to open the **Backup** pane for that cluster, where you can proceed with installing the extension, configuring backups, or viewing existing backups.

### Backup sample prompts

Here are a few examples of the kinds of prompts you can use to manage AKS cluster backups.  Modify these prompts based on your real-life scenarios, or try additional prompts to get different kinds of information.

- "Install backup extension on my AKS cluster"
- "Configure AKS backup"
- "Manage backup extension on my AKS cluster"
- "I want to view the backups on my AKS cluster"

### Backup example

You can say **"Install AKS backup"** to start the process of installing the AKS backup extension. After you select a cluster, you're prompted to open its **Backup** pane. From there, select **Launch install backup** to open the experience. After reviewing the prerequisites for the extension, you can step through the installation process.
