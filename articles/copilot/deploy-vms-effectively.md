## Choose the right size for your VMs

Azure offers several size options based on your workload needs. Microsoft Copilot in Azure can help you identify the best VM size based on your scenario needs and assess it in the context of your other configuration requirements.  

When you share your intent and scenario, Copilot helps you narrow down the right VM size from the vast size selection offered by Azure today. Copilot helps you identify requirements without requiring you to know the exact amount of RAM or CPU that you need. Size recommendations also take any quota and offer restrictions into account and surface the most intelligent recommendations pertinently. Copilot can also help you create a support request to increase a quota if desired.

While familiarity with the size options can be beneficial, Copilot in Azure is designed to assist you regardless of your expertise level. However, it's crucial that you exercise due diligence with the suggested options.

### VM size sample prompts

- "Help me choose a size for my virtual machine"
- "Which VM size will best suit my requirements?"

### VM size examples

Ask "**Help me choose a size for my VM,**", or select the **Help me choose the right VM size for my workload** button near the top of the pane. Copilot in Azure asks for some more information to help it determine the best options.

:::image type="content" source="media/deploy-vms-effectively/vm-choose-size.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Microsoft Copilot in Azure asking for details to help determine the appropriate VM size.":::

After that, Copilot in Azure presents some options and lets you choose which of the recommended sizes to use for your VM.

## Copy VMs into any region

Microsoft Copilot in Azure can help you replicate existing VMs in the region of your choice. If the selected region has a low probability of deployment success, Copilot in Azure suggests alternate recommendations for the region, VM size, or availability zone. Additionally, Copilot showcases existing properties that are copied to the new VM from the existing VM, lets you know if any properties aren't supported and can't be copied over, and guides you to a prefilled creation experience where you can deploy VMs quickly and enable microproductivity gains.

Copilot can also advise you of scenarios where existing related services may not be easily attached to the new VM copy. For instance, if address space gets exhausted by reusing the existing VM's virtual network or subnet for new Virtual Machine copy, you'll be prompted to adjust network settings appropriately. Similarly, if the backend pool of an existing load balancer linked with the existing VM is exhausted, you're notified and will be able to update your load balancer/application gateway configuration settings.

When using Copilot in Azure to help you copy VMs, keep in mind the following:

- The cost of the new VM may differ from the existing VM, depending on licensing and usage implications.
- Licensing and password credentials aren't copied automatically. You can configure these during the creation experience.
- You can't use Copilot to copy an existing VM if it has errors or is in a failed state.
- Data disks and OS disks can't be reused or copied, but the configuration of the OS disks and data disks will be copied over (if present in the existing VM).

While familiarity with the pricing information of different VM configurations can be beneficial, Copilot in Azure is designed to assist users ranging across different expertise levels in achieving their deployment goals. However, it is crucial that you exercise due diligence with the suggested options.
