# Discover Azure Marketplace solutions using Microsoft Copilot in Azure

Microsoft Copilot in Azure enables you to find the right Azure Marketplace solutions using natural language queries. Instead of relying on filters or knowing specific product names, you can describe your needs in your own words and get tailored suggestions.

When you ask a question about tools and offers, Copilot in Azure determines your intent, then enriches your query with context and inferred filters. Next, it searches the Azure Marketplace using intelligent APIs and returns a list of the top relevant offers, services, or follow-ups. Where applicable, an **"Explore Marketplace"** button is provided to navigate directly to the Azure Marketplace so you can explore and implement the suggested solutions. Copilot may also provide follow-up questions or related prompts to refine your search or explore other solutions.

## Sample prompts

Here are a few examples of the kinds of prompts you can use to discover Azure Marketplace solutions. Modify these prompts based on your real-life scenarios, or try additional prompts to explore different solutions.

- "Show me database offers for scalable cloud storage."
- "List AI-powered virtual machine configurations for data analysis."
- "I'm looking for a service to analyze customer sentiment from voice recordings."
- "Show me virtual machine options optimized for machine learning workloads."
- "I'm looking for a tool to transcribe audio files into text."
- "What are the best blockchain solutions for supply chain management?"
- "I need a service for converting speech to multiple languages in real-time."
- "Can you suggest blockchain platforms for creating smart contracts?"
- "List virtual machines with GPU support for AI model training."
- "Can you recommend blockchain services for tokenizing digital assets?"
- "Show me virtual machine offers with pre-installed development tools."
- "I'm looking for a speech-to-text API for integrating into my application."
