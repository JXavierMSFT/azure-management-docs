# Generate Azure CLI scripts using Microsoft Copilot in Azure

Microsoft Copilot in Azure can generate [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/) scripts that you can use to create or manage resources.

When you tell Microsoft Copilot in Azure about a task you want to perform by using Azure CLI, it provides a script with the necessary commands. You'll see which placeholder values that you need to update with the actual values based on your environment.

> [!TIP]
> You can also get help from Copilot in Azure [directly from your command-line interface](ai-shell-overview.md).

## Sample prompts

Here are a few examples of the kinds of prompts you can use to generate Azure CLI scripts. Some prompts will return a single command, while others provide multiple steps walking through the full scenario. Modify these prompts based on your real-life scenarios, or try additional prompts to create different kinds of queries.

- "Give me a CLI script to create a new storage account"
- "How do I list all my VMs using Azure CLI?"
- "Create a virtual network with two subnets using the address space of 10.0.0.0/16 using az cli"
- "I need to assign a dns name to a vm using a script"
- "How to attach a disk to a VM using az cli"
- "How to create and manage a Linux pool in Azure Batch using cli"
- "Show me how to back up and restore a web app from a backup using cli"
- "Create VNet service endpoints for Azure Database for PostgreSQL using CLI"
- "I want to create a function app with a named storage account connection using Azure CLI"
- "How to create an App Service app and deploy code to a staging environment using CLI"
- "I want to use Azure CLI to deploy and manage AKS using a private service endpoint."

## Examples

In this example, the prompt "**I want to use Azure CLI to create a new storage account**" provides an example command.

For tasks that require multiple commands, Copilot in Azure can provide a script that you can copy and paste. For example, when you say "**I want to create a function app with a named storage account connection using Azure CLI**", Copilot in Azure provides a full script with comments for each section, along with a brief explanation of what the script does.
